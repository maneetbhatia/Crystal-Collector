**Instructions:**

- There will be four crystals displayed as buttons on the page.
  The player will be shown a random number at the start of the game.

- When the player clicks on a crystal, it will add a specific amount of points to the player's total score.

- Your game will hide this amount until the player clicks a crystal.
  When they do click one, update the player's score counter.

- The player wins if their total score matches the random number from the beginning of the game.
  The player loses if their score goes above the random number.

- The game restarts whenever the player wins or loses.

- When the game begins again, the player should see a new random number. Also, all the crystals will have four new hidden values. Of course, the user's score (and score counter) will reset to zero.
